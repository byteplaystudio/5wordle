## 🎮 About Wordle

Wordle is a web-based word game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback using colored tiles:

- 🟩 Green: Letter is correct and in the right position
- 🟨 Yellow: Letter exists in the word but is in the wrong position
- ⬜ Gray: Letter is not in the word

The game has gained massive popularity for its simple yet engaging mechanics and the social aspect of everyone trying to guess the same word each day.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Type any five-letter word as your first guess.
2. **Get Feedback**: The tiles will change color to show how close your guess was.
3. **Use the Clues**: Green tiles mean the letter is correct and in the right spot. Yellow tiles mean the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot. Gray tiles mean the letter isn't in the word.
4. **Keep Guessing**: Use the feedback to make better guesses. You have six tries to get the word right!
5. **Win or Lose**: Guess the word within six tries to win! If you don't get it, don't worry - there's always tomorrow's word.
